        <h1>The Programming contest</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Programmers compete against each other to solve programming questions
          in a limited amount of time. Contestants solve logical or
          mathematical programming questions in the coding language of their
          choice. The number of questions can vary depending on the contest,
          and most competitive programming contests have prizes. Entering
          programming contests is a great way to improve your problem-solving
          and programming skills. During the contest, you’ll be given complex
          problems that you’ll have to solve in a limited time. Many of those
          problems are new and you may have never run into before. Solving
          them will improve your analytical thinking skills and teach you
          more about the programming language you chose to compete with.
          And these are skills that will help you in your career.
